        "Movie_Review:": "\"Black Bear\" is something of a Rorschach indie film, its two halves mirroring each other, demanding the viewer's own take. At the beginning of the movie from writer/director Lawrence Michael Levine, Aubrey Plaza plays a struggling indie filmmaker named Allison who has retreated an Airbnb cabin in the woods, in search of focus for her next script. What follows is not surprising in terms of indie movie plotting, but like everything in Levine's film, it must be seen to be emotionally understood: namely, that Airbnb owner Gabe (Christopher Abbott) develops a clumsy attraction to Allison, which upsets his pregnant girlfriend Blair (Sarah Gadon). The tension increases between the three of them, and it becomes exhausting, and finally, destructive. With half a movie left to go, this proves to be like a referential text for what follows."

With this rich and nimble episode also marking the first time that our bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) has met a character who uses the Force like the Skywalkers and others before her, it’s a thrilling mix of old lore and new paths, showing where “Star Wars” has been but also the many possibilities ahead. Written and directed by Dave Filoni, it’s also an episode that could be enjoyed without getting the references, as it reintroduces Jedis with their exhilarating cinematic roots of samurai stories."

        "Movie_Review:": "\"Black Bear\" is something of a Rorschach indie film, its two halves mirroring each other, demanding the viewer's own take. At the beginning of the movie from writer/director Lawrence Michael Levine, Aubrey Plaza plays a struggling indie filmmaker named Allison who has retreated an Airbnb cabin in the woods, in search of focus for her next script. What follows is not surprising in terms of indie movie plotting, but like everything in Levine's film, it must be seen to be emotionally understood: namely, that Airbnb owner Gabe (Christopher Abbott) develops a clumsy attraction to Allison, which upsets his pregnant girlfriend Blair (Sarah Gadon). The tension increases between the three of them, and it becomes exhausting, and finally, destructive. With half a movie left to go, this proves to be like a referential text for what follows."

With this rich and nimble episode also marking the first time that our bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) has met a character who uses the Force like the Skywalkers and others before her, it’s a thrilling mix of old lore and new paths, showing where “Star Wars” has been but also the many possibilities ahead. Written and directed by Dave Filoni, it’s also an episode that could be enjoyed without getting the references, as it reintroduces Jedis with their exhilarating cinematic roots of samurai stories."

But it's so resoundingly slack and lazily written that neither its horror or comedy have that vital sense of timing, or danger. It’s a “Ghostbusters”-like saga with a stale sense of humor, with only a little more creativity when it comes to the actual spooky stuff."

What follows is not surprising in terms of indie movie plotting, but like everything in Levine's film, it must be seen to be emotionally understood: namely, that Airbnb owner Gabe (Christopher Abbott) develops a clumsy attraction to Allison, which upsets his pregnant girlfriend Blair (Sarah Gadon). The tension increases between the three of them, and it becomes exhausting, and finally, destructive. With half a movie left to go, this proves to be like a referential text for what follows."

At the beginning of the movie from writer/director Lawrence Michael Levine, Aubrey Plaza plays a struggling indie filmmaker named Allison who has retreated an Airbnb cabin in the woods, in search of focus for her next script. What follows is not surprising in terms of indie movie plotting, but like everything in Levine's film, it must be seen to be emotionally understood: namely, that Airbnb owner Gabe (Christopher Abbott) develops a clumsy attraction to Allison, which upsets his pregnant girlfriend Blair (Sarah Gadon). The tension increases between the three of them, and it becomes exhausting, and finally, destructive. With half a movie left to go, this proves to be like a referential text for what follows."

With this rich and nimble episode also marking the first time that our bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) has met a character who uses the Force like the Skywalkers and others before her, it’s a thrilling mix of old lore and new paths, showing where “Star Wars” has been but also the many possibilities ahead.

        "Movie_Review:": "When sketch comedy finds a wide audience, it’s like lightning in a bottle. Think of how The Lonely Island used to dominate “Saturday Night Live” with their digital shorts, or how Tim Robinson made a cult Netflix hit out of his 2019 series, “I Think You Should Leave.” Netflix seeks to replicate some of Robinson’s meme-able success with its extremely funny new sketch show “Aunty Donna’s Big Ol’ House of Fun,” starring the Aussie trio Aunty Donna (Mark Samual Bonanno, Broden Kelly, and Zachary Ruane). They've been making absurdist comedy for years (along with series director Max Miller), and treat the premise here of three roommates living together as a wall-breaking, dimension-diving, musical free-for-all for their immense satirical and comic energy."

        "Movie_Review:": "You really can’t trust a soul in the wild galaxy of Disney+'s “The Mandalorian.” You could be blitzing away from the sandy ghost town of Mos Pelgo after a Krayt dragon kill well-done, and suddenly get tripped up by pirates who trash your speeder, and threaten to kill your precious baby cargo. Director Peyton Reed’s “Chapter 10: The Passenger” kicks off this second episode of season two on such a sprightly note, and it has a couple fun, inventive ways for our bounty hunting hero Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) to get on his way. But what does he do with all of his cargo, including the armor of Boba Fett, which he retrieved in the previous episode, \"The Marshal\"? He just carries it on his back and walks. How long is that walk, if he had to zoom through a sandy expanse that in the last episode required a full montage? No matter, “The Mandalorian” is onto the next thing, and this episode can be a little sly with such plotting, however sporadically thrilling."

        "Movie_Review:": "We may not be getting a new “Star Wars” movie this year (or even next), but we’ll at least have “The Mandalorian,” a serial that proves with one of its best episodes yet that it still has a lot of flair, inspiration, and jetpack fuel to go around. Directed by Jon Favreau, this first episode in the second season is a great example of how the series can work across scale—it can be intimate when it's two characters exchanging information in a vast open landscape, and it can also be massive with action scenes worthy of IMAX. The third act of this episode in particular made me miss experiencing new \"Star Wars\" stories in a theater."

        "Movie_Review:": "“Truth Seekers” is the kind of show that seems to thrive on all that is mild, despite playing with two genres that are inherently tricky to do well. This horror-comedy series just wants to make you chuckle, and with regards to its potential scares, only a little anxious. But it's so resoundingly slack and lazily written that neither its horror or comedy have that vital sense of timing, or danger. It’s a “Ghostbusters”-like saga with a stale sense of humor, with only a little more creativity when it comes to the actual spooky stuff."
